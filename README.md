## Description
This project is designed to optimize inventory management by forecasting demand, optimizing inventory levels, and simulating different scenarios. The project uses machine learning algorithms, dynamic programming, and simulation techniques to provide accurate and reliable results.

## Features
*   **Demand Forecasting**: Uses machine learning algorithms to forecast demand based on historical data.
*   **Inventory Optimization**: Uses dynamic programming to optimize inventory levels based on forecasted demand.
*   **Simulation**: Simulates different demand scenarios to test the robustness of the inventory management strategy.
